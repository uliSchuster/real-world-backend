# Tooling Setup

## Github
- Invitations to Mona, Joan and Shivam sent and accepted. Thus, the four collaborators so far do have access.
- Joan gives a demo on how to clone the repository locally, branch, and issue a pull request (PR)


## Decisions
- All code needs to go through a review by another collaborator. There is a rule now in force that prevents merging a branch.
- Everyone gets their stack/git/editor setup in place. If you are done, announce it in slack.
